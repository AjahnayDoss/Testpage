<p>About Me 
Hello, My name is Ajahnay S. Doss. Im 15 years old I grew up in East St Louis but I currently live in Granite city illinois. I have have 6 siblings, 4 brothers and two sisters. I also go SIUE to Charter High School. I have an 3.8 GPA on the road to an 4.0. Things I like to do is Shopping, Getting my nails and hair done, And riding around with my brother. Like I said I have 6 siblings  but I dont live with all of my siblings just one of them because they other have moved out. The one brother that is still in the house I am the closets with. It really is shocking to me that I am that close to my second oldest brother because when we were little we wasnt really that close. We would always argue and fight with each other that it would look like we hated each other. But over the time with other siblings leaving we just had no choice but to be close but i didnt expect it to be this close.
Now my biggest role model, my Mother.  My mother also gave me an amazing life. She cared for me gave me Shelther, food, protection and also made sure that I had a good bill of health. I just know that I want to continue to make my mother proud.</p>
